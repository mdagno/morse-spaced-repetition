## Spaced repetition capstone
This app allows uers to practice learning a language through the spaced repetition revision technique. Users can create an account and have access to a library of characters on the home dashboard.  Users can then practice by being shown a character and submit a guess.  They will then receive feedback with the total score and the correct and incorrect count for that character. The next wcharacters in sequence are determiend by the spaced repetition algorithm.

The currently available language option in this app is morse corde.
